# LINEAR REGRESSION WITH SCIKIT-LEARN

Machine Learning course demo and assignment  

# AUTHOR: Maria Ingold

## UoEO MSc AI Machine Learning

* Assignment Date: 18 November, 2024
* Linear regression with scikit-learn tutorial

## Demo from UoEO (had to be fixed as did not run)

* Code: correlation_regression_fuel_consumption.ipynb
* Data part 1: FuelConsumption.csv
* Data part 2: gdp_per_capita.csv

## Unit 4 Assignment 

* Code: 4_correlation_regression.ipynb
* Data: global_population.csv, global_GDP.csv
* Using data from global_population.csv & global_GDP.csv, undertake the following tasks.

### Task A: Correlation

* Pre-process the data - mean population of each country and mean per capita GDP (from 2001 to 2021) by making some arrangements for the missing values
* (HINT: You will need to use the datasets Global_GDP.csv and Global_Population.csv).
* Investigate any correlation between the mean population of each country and the mean per capita GDP (from 2001 to 2021).
* Very briefly, interpret the generated plot. Evaluate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.

### Task B: Regression

* Perform linear regression, where the independent variable is the mean population of each country (from 2001 to 2021) and dependent variable is mean per capita GDP (from 2001 to 2021).
